# Sentinel-Logic-Labs 🛡️📡

Welcome to my **Mission-Critical Logic Laboratory**. This repository serves as a specialized bunker for mastering core programming languages (Java & C++) with a focus on high-performance systems, radar simulation, and software resilience.

## 🎯 Purpose
The goal of this repository is to document my journey through advanced software engineering concepts, moving from high-level enterprise Java to low-level, real-time C++ systems.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Focus Areas

### ☕ Java SE 8 (Associate & Professional)
Focused on mastering the **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** internals for enterprise-grade applications.
* **Exception Hierarchy:** Ensuring 100% fault tolerance in critical flows.
* **Memory Management:** Understanding Heap/Stack and Garbage Collection behavior.
* **Data Integrity:** Validating data types and variable scopes for secure processing.

### 📡 C++ (Systems & Defense Systems)
Focused on **Mission-Critical** logic, inspired by radar systems and aerospace engineering.
* **Manual Memory Management:** Mastering Pointers (`*`) and References (`&`).
* **Performance:** Writing high-speed code for real-time data processing.
* **System Hardening:** Developing C++ logic that runs efficiently on Linux environments.
